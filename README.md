# Bresenham Algorithm

This was my attempt to explain the Bresenham Algorithm for line circle and ellipse drawing. The algorithm was so fascinating at the time I was learning (it still is), I decided to write about it. It grew to this document.

Initially I made the document in `libreoffice writer` and later transported to $\LaTeX$. You can find both versions here.
